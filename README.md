# plugin.program.autocompletion
Plugin to provide autocompletion for the virtual keyboard (needs skin support)

Will be working only with https://github.com/xulek/script.module.autocompletion

The autocompletion is limited to a global/kodi builtin search. With plugins cause Kodi19 application to crash. This is a 99% KODI bug.

Resolved crash under Kodi 18.x on RPI
